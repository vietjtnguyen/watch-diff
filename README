usage: watch-diff [OPTIONS] -- COMMAND...

DESCRIPTION

This program will execute the provided command at a regular interval
(time defined by the -i option). On the first invocation the entire
command output (which we call a "snapshot") is printed. In subsequent
invocations only the diff with the previous output is printed. If the
diff is empty then nothing is printed. A timestamp (produced by 'date -u
"+%s.%N (%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%N)"') is printed before any snapshot or diff
is printed (except on empty diffs). At regular intervals (controlled with
the -s option) a "snapshot", which is just the full output of the command,
is printed instead of the diff (think I-frames in video encoding).

    -D DIFF_OPTIONS
        Options to send to diff. If the command output changes whitespace
        often (like ss with its output table formatting) then useful diff
        options to use are "-B -Z -b" which are ignore blank lines, ignore
        trailing whitespace, and ignore changes in amount of whitespace.

    -I IDENTIFIER
        Identifier output before timestamp to help with searching/parsing
        through the output. (default: WATCHDIFF)

    -S COMMAND_SHELL
        If specified the command is invoked with the provided shell
        by running $COMMAND_SHELL -c "$*". By default the command is
        invoked directly in this bash script by running "$@".

    -h
        Print this help/usage text.

    -i INTERVAL_SEC
        Time interval, in seconds, between invocations of
        command. (default: 1 second)

    -s SNAPSHOT_INTERVAL
        Count interval between output of snapshots (full command output
        instead of a diff). Every SNAPSHOT_INTERVAL the output of the
        command is printed instead of the diff. If set to 1 then every
        command invocation will output a snapshot. If set to 0 then all
        command invocations after the first will be diffs (essentially
        disabling snapshots). (default: 100)

EXAMPLES

    Watch for changes to a folder.
        watch-diff -s 1000 -- ls -l

    Use ps to watch for changes in processes.
        watch-diff -D "-B -Z -b" -S bash -- ps aux '|' sort -g -k2

    Use ss to watch for changes in socket state.
        watch-diff -D "-B -Z -b" -S bash -- ss -H -t -u -a -4 -O -p '|' sort

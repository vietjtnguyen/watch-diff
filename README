usage: watch-diff [OPTIONS] -- COMMAND...

DESCRIPTION

This program will execute the provided command at a regular interval
(time defined by the -i option) and print the output of the command to
standard out. It prints out both "snapshots" which are the full output
of the command as well as "diffs" which are the diffs between the latest
command output and the last one. How often a snapshot is printed is
controlled with the -s option.

    -D DIFF_OPTIONS
        Options to send to diff. If the command output changes whitespace
        often (like ss) then useful diff options to use are "-B -Z -b"
        which are ignore blank lines, ignore trailing whitespace, and
        ignore changes in amount of whitespace.

    -I IDENTIFIER
        Identifier output before timestamp to search for to help separate
        output. (default: WATCHDIFF)

    -S COMMAND_SHELL
        If specified the command is invoked with the provided shell
        by running $COMMAND_SHELL -c "$*". By default the command is
        invoked directly in this bash script by running "$@".

    -h
        Print this help/usage text.

    -i INTERVAL_SEC
        Time interval, in seconds, between invocations of
        command. (default: 1 second)

    -s SNAPSHOT_INTERVAL
        Count interval between output of snapshots (full command output
        instead of a diff). Every SNAPSHOT_INTERVAL the output of the
        command is printed instead of the diff. If set to 1 then every
        command invocation will output a snapshot. If set to 0 then all
        command invocations after the first will be diffs (essentially
        disabling snapshots). (default: 100)

EXAMPLES

    Watch for changes to a folder.
        watch-diff -s 1000 -- ls -l

    Use ps to watch for changes in processes.
        watch-diff -D "-B -Z -b" -S bash -- ps aux '|' sort -g -k2

    Use ss to watch for changes in socket state.
        watch-diff -D "-B -Z -b" -S bash -- ss -H -t -u -a -4 -O -p '|' sort
